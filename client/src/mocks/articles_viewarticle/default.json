  "BodyText": "By default, every email deleted from your OWA mailbox goes through the following process:\\r\\n1. The email is moved to your Deleted Items folder.\\r\\n2. If you purge or remove items from your Deleted Items folder they will be moved to the Dumpster where they are still recoverable.\\r\\n3. The Dumpster only holds email message for 14 days once they've been removed from Deleted Items.\\r\\nDeleted email can be recovered from the Deleted Items folder or the Dumpster. Once it has been permanently deleted from the dumpster it can not be recovered.\\r\\nNote: Desktop clients (e.g., Outlook, Entourage, Apple Mail) may be configured to use a local trash system or be configured to purge email from the Deleted Items folder more quickly than 14 days.\\r\\nDeleted Email Recovery is only available in OWA or Outlook."
